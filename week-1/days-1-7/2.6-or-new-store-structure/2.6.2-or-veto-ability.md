# 2.6.2 | Veto Ability

Mistakes don't happen in a vacuum. In a perfect system, checks and balances will keep the different superpowers in check. One of these checks and balances is the Veto power. Any decisions a upper level supervisor makes can be vetoed by another supervisor. Assistant managers can be vetoed by either another Assistant Manager or the Manager. The Manager can be vetoed with a combination vote from both of the Assistant Managers.
